Thanks very much for your excellent tutorials and dependable code. It will take some time for me to review the code and digest how it all works. With Scenebuilder, I did everything in Design mode following your instructions. But for the Person class, controllers, and MainApp I just copied your code to get it to work. But when I start my own projects, I'll need to understand all of your code. Although we used Java 1.8 here and many new concepts, there were no operational differences, correct? I like to understand what benefits come with each new feature. But thanks for your sharing this; a great service for your fellow coders.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden"

It takes quite some time to go trough the entire tutorial; you might be the first one - at least the first one leaving a comment! It's always great to hear that it is of help to other people.</p><p>Yes, this AddressApp does pretty much the same as the JavaFX 2 AddressApp but in a newer and somewhat more elegant way.</p><p>About Java 8 "benefits": I see two sides to Java 8. First, I'm quite excited about the new features. The included JavaFX 8 is great, I really like the Date and Time API and also (some of) the new language features. But I see a great problem with all those new language features. As it is really appealing for an experienced Java programmer it gets more difficult to understand for someone rather new to Java. Every new feature increases the complexity.</p><p>A quick example: I can think of at least six possible ways to write a handler for a button click with Java 8 (and I'm sure there are more than that)! With Java 7 it was roughly half as many possibilities.</p><p>Now, if someone who's learning Java is seeking a solution, it is really confusing to see that many different ways of achieving the same thing. I won't go too much further into that here (maybe in a later blog post, we'll see).</p><p>But don't get discouraged. I think after completing this tutorial you should be able to read Java 8 code and mostly have a feeling about what it's doing. Don't worry too much about if you're implementing something in "old" Java style or in "new" Java 8 style - that doesn't matter much. But it is relevant that you can read other people's code.</p><p>- Marco</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden"

You said you want to avoid inserting "logging code into the application code". It's actually a good practice and important to add logging to a project. In production you'll likely disable most logging with just some simple settings. Then the logging code will automatically be removed by the compiler.</p><p>Maybe try this tutorial here: <a

Jakob - this has been one the best tutorials I've seen on JavaFx. plus being a newbie, your clean coding structure helped me understand, i am like George, i need to digest for a bit. if you ever get a chance I'd like to see a tutorial with this AddressApp and DataFx - i am going to attempt, to structure it as such.</p><p>And Thank You for taking the time with this, good stuff.</p></div></div><span

I've run through both the original and the Java 8.  I have one a couple of questions on how Inno Setup works though that I haven't been able to figure out.  My problems are (this is all windows installer related):<br>1. I don't get a desktop icon from the installer.  The installer works fine, the .exe file is installed and runs perfectly and I can manually create a shortcut that also works, I just want a desktop icon installed.<br>2. Where/how is the installer file name set - mine comes out with a 1.0 name even though in the build.fxbuild I told it 2.0.3.  I couldn't find how this was configured - I assumed it was in the build.xml somewhere, but don't quite get how that file links up to Inno Setup.</p><p>Thanks again for the great tutorials.<br>jay</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see
